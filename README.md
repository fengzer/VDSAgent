# VDSAgent: A PCS-Guided Multi-Agent System for Veridical Data Science Automation

**VDSAgents** is a multi-agent system guided by the Predictability-Computability-Stability (PCS) principles, designed to automate veridical data science. The system implements a modular and interpretable workflow for data cleaning, feature engineering, modeling, and evaluation. Each phase is managed by an elegant agent, ensuring both functionality and scientific auditability.

## üåü Key Features

- **DSLC Data Science Workflow**: Automates various stages of data science
- **PCS Principles**: Ensures system reliability and robustness
- **Multi-Dataset Evaluation**: Validated across diverse datasets

Special thanks to Silan Hu for providing an online version of the project, which requires no installation. You can access it at [https://easy-notebook.silan.tech/](https://easy-notebook.silan.tech/).

## üì¶ Installation

**Note:** This project requires Python 3.9 or above.

### Using Conda

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate VDSAgent
```

### Using Pip

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üöÄ QuickStart

To configure the project, you need to fill in the `config.py` file with your API details:

1. **BASE_URL**: Set this to the base URL of your API service.
2. **API_KEY**: Enter your API key here.

These configurations are necessary for the language model to function correctly. Ensure that you have the correct permissions and access rights to use the API.

To use your own dataset, please store your training and test data in the `data_science_project` directory following this structure:

```
- data_science_project/
  - <your_project_name>/
    - data/
      - train.csv
      - test.csv
```

Next, open the `run_experiments.py` file and modify the following parameters in the `main` function:

1. `COMPETITION_NAME`: Set this to your project name, e.g., `COMPETITION_NAME = '<your_project_name>'`.
2. `PROBLEM_DESCRIPTION` and `CONTEXT_DESCRIPTION`: Optionally, update these strings to describe your specific problem and context.

After making these changes, you can run your experiments using the following command:

```bash
python run_experiments.py
```
